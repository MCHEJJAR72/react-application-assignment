1. Set Up Your React Project
First, create a new React application using Create React App:
npx create-react-app marvel-characters-app
cd marvel-characters-app

2. Install Required Packages
You'll need several packages for routing, form handling, Firebase authentication, etc. Install them using npm or yarn:
npm install react-router-dom axios react-hook-form firebase

3. Create Components
Create the necessary components for your application. Here is a suggested list:
Home: Landing page component.
Dashboard: Main dashboard displaying Marvel characters.
CharacterList: Component to list characters.
CharacterForm: Form to add or edit characters.
Login: Component for login using Firebase authentication.
Create these components in the src/components folder.

4. Set Up Routing
Use react-router-dom for routing between different components. Define routes in your App.js:
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Switch, Route } from 'react-router-dom';
import Home from './components/Home';
import Dashboard from './components/Dashboard';
import Login from './components/Login';

function App() {
  return (
    <Router>
      <Switch>
        <Route exact path="/" component={Home} />
        <Route path="/dashboard" component={Dashboard} />
        <Route path="/login" component={Login} />
        {/* Add more routes as needed */}
      </Switch>
    </Router>
export default App;

5. Implement Firebase Authentication
Set up Firebase authentication in your Firebase project console. Configure Firebase in your React app (src/firebase.js):
import firebase from 'firebase/app';
import 'firebase/auth';const firebaseConfig = { // Your Firebase config details}
firebase.initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
export const auth = firebase.auth();
export default firebase

6. Create API Interaction
Use axios to fetch data from your Flask API. Create a custom hook (useMarvelCharacters.js) to manage API calls using useState and useEffect:
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';import axios from 'axios'

7. Implement CRUD Operations
In your Dashboard component, use useMarvelCharacters hook to fetch and display characters. Implement CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) using Axios calls to your Flask API endpoints.

8. Create Forms with react-hook-form
Use react-hook-form for form handling (CharacterForm.js):

import { useForm } from 'react-hook-form';const CharacterForm = ({ onSubmit }) =>
 
{const { register, handleSubmit } = useForm();const handleFormSubmit = (data) => {
 onSubmit(data)}
  return ( <form onSubmit={handleSubmit(handleFormSubmit)}> {/* Form fields using register */}
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>
  export default CharacterForm

9. Host Your Application
Deploy your React application to Firebase Hosting:
npm install -g firebase-tools
firebase login
firebase init
# Follow the prompts to initialize Firebase hosting
npm run build
firebase deploy
Ensure your Flask API is also deployed and update the API URL in your React app to the deployed version.

10. Test and Debug
Test your application locally and after deployment to Firebase Hosting. Ensure CRUD operations and authentication work as expected.
